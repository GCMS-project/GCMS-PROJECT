## 🚀 Branching Workflow

### Current Status
```
main (production) ← develop (staging) ← feature/bugfix branches
```

### Development Process
1. **Start from develop**: `git checkout develop && git pull`
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Develop and commit**: Use conventional commit messages
4. **Push and create PR**: `git push -u origin feature/your-feature`
5. **Code review**: PR from feature → develop
6. **Merge to main**: PR from develop → main (requires 2 approvals)

## 🔒 Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (2 approvals)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Include administrators
- ✅ Restrict direct pushes

### Develop Branch
- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Restrict direct pushes

## 📋 Branch Types

| Type | Format | Purpose | Source | Target |
|------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| `main` | - | Production code | - | - |
| `develop` | - | Integration | - | - |
| `feature/*` | `feature/description` | New features | `develop` | `develop` |
| `bugfix/*` | `bugfix/description` | Bug fixes | `develop` | `develop` |
| `hotfix/*` | `hotfix/description` | Critical fixes | `main` | `main` + `develop` |
| `release/*` | `release/version` | Release prep | `develop` | `main` + `develop` |

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to Settings > Branches
3. Add branch protection rules for `main` and `develop`
4. Configure required reviewers and status checks

### 2. Set Up Environments
1. Go to Settings > Environments
2. Create `staging` environment (for develop branch)
3. Create `production` environment (for main branch)
4. Configure protection rules

### 3. Team Training
1. Share the branching strategy documentation
2. Train team on the workflow
3. Set up code review guidelines
4. Establish commit message standards

### 4. Start Development
```bash
# Example: Starting a new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard
# ... make changes ...
git commit -m "feat: add user dashboard component"
git push -u origin feature/user-dashboard
# Create PR: feature/user-dashboard → develop
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration
